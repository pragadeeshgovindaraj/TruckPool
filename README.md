Efficient LTL Logistics: Building Shipper and Carriers

TruckPool is conceived as an innovative web-based application intended to streamline Less Than Truckload (LTL) shipping across the challenging landscape of Canada. The initiative aimed to enhance the connection between carriers and shippers, facilitating more efficient routes and better load utilization amidst the significant distances between major urban centers and the sparse population density. The project's cornerstone was the construction of a robust platform utilizing Django, Python, and SQLite, providing an integrated suite of functionalities tailored to the unique demands of Canadian logistics.
